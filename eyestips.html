            <h2>General Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Get regular eye exams. This is the best way to detect any eye problems early on, when they are most easily treated.</li>
                <li>Wear sunglasses. Sunglasses protect your eyes from harmful UV rays, which can damage the retina and lead to cataracts and macular degeneration.</li>
                <li>Quit smoking. Smoking damages blood vessels in the retina, which can lead to vision loss.</li>
                <li>Eat a healthy diet. Eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help protect your eyes from age-related eye diseases.</li>
                <li>Get enough sleep. When you're well-rested, your eyes are better able to focus and adjust to changes in light.</li>
                <li>Avoid excessive screen time. Staring at screens for long periods of time can strain your eyes and lead to dry eyes. Take breaks every 20-30 minutes to look away from the screen and focus on something else.</li>
                <li>Manage your stress levels. Stress can contribute to eye problems such as dry eyes and blurred vision. Find healthy ways to manage stress, such as exercise, yoga, or meditation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>For Computer Users</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Adjust the brightness and contrast of your screen. Make sure the text is easy to read and that there is no glare.</li>
                <li>Take breaks every 20-30 minutes. Look away from the screen and focus on something else for 20 seconds.</li>
                <li>Use the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.</li>
                <li>Flicker-free screens. These screens reduce eye strain and fatigue.</li>
                <li>Blue light filter. This filter can help reduce the amount of blue light emitted from screens, which can be harmful to the eyes.</li>
            </ul>
